This is a template object, copying this directory and editing it should
make it easy to create new objects. It implements a simple SVM for
pattern recognition. 

The files are the following:

template.m % constructor -- needs to include all hyperparameter and model 
           %                parameter declarations

training.m % these two files are the core of any object -- they train

testing.m  % the algorithm given data and test the learnt model

get_name.m % used for printing the name, you only need to edit this file
           % if you want to output special hyperparameters of your object
           % when the name is printed out

subsref.m % used for getting parameters, you do not need to edit this file

subsasgn.m% used for setting parameters, you do not need to edit this file



PROGRAMMING GUIDELINES:

1) If you use a kernel, try to call train and test members of kernel, see
e.g the svm object. This will help to make complex kernel objects, e.g 
feed_fwd networks of kernels.

2) always use get, get_x, set_x of data objects, and try not to create 
new data objects, otherwise you may lose e.g indexing information if you
do not copy it -- see e.g svm object.
