%% CVT_ITERATE takes one step of the CVT iteration.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The routine is given a set of points, called "generators", which
%    define a tessellation of the region into Voronoi cells.  Each point
%    defines a cell.  Each cell, in turn, has a centroid, but it is
%    unlikely that the centroid and the generator coincide.
%
%    Each time this CVT iteration is carried out, an attempt is made
%    to modify the generators in such a way that they are closer and
%    closer to being the centroids of the Voronoi cells they generate.
%
%    A large number of sample points are generated, and the nearest generator
%    is determined.  A count is kept of how many points were nearest to each
%    generator.  Once the sampling is completed, the location of all the
%    generators is adjusted.  This step should decrease the discrepancy
%    between the generators and the centroids.
%
%    The centroidal Voronoi tessellation minimizes the "energy",
%    defined to be the integral, over the region, of the square of
%    the distance between each point in the region and its nearest generator.
%    The sampling technique supplies a discrete estimate of this
%    energy.

%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, integer DIM_NUM, the spatial dimension.
%
%    Input, integer N, the number of Voronoi cells.
%
%    Input, integer BATCH, sets the maximum number of sample points
%    generated at one time.  It is inefficient to generate the sample
%    points 1 at a time, but memory intensive to generate them all
%    at once.  You might set BATCH to min ( SAMPLE_NUM, 10000 ), for instance.
%    BATCH must be at least 1.
%
%    Input, integer SAMPLE, specifies how the sampling is done.
%    -1, 'RAND', using MATLAB's RAND function;
%     0, 'UNIFORM', using a simple uniform RNG;
%     1, 'HALTON', from a Halton sequence;
%     2, 'GRID', points from a grid;
%     3, 'USER', refers to the USER routine;
%
%    Input, logical INITIALIZE, is TRUE if the SEED must be reset to SEED_INIT
%    before computation.  Also, the pseudorandom process may need to be
%    reinitialized.
%
%    Input, integer SAMPLE_NUM, the number of sample points.
%
%    Input, integer SEED, the random number seed.
%
%    Input, real R(DIM_NUM,N), the Voronoi cell generators.
%
%    Output, real R(DIM_NUM,N), the updated Voronoi cell generators.
%
%    Output, integer SEED, the updated random number seed.
%
%    Output, real IT_DIFF, the L2 norm of the difference
%    between the iterates.
%
%    Output, real ENERGY, the discrete "energy", divided
%    by the number of sample points.
%

%
%  Take each generator as the first sample point for its region.
%  This can slightly slow the convergence, but it simplifies the
%  algorithm by guaranteeing that no region is completely missed
%  by the sampling.
