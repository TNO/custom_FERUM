The libsvm license ("the modified BSD license")
is compatible with many
free software licenses such as GPL. Hence, it is very easy to
use libsvm in your software.
It can also be used in commercial products.

<p>
Build it as a project by choosing "Win32 Project."
On the other hand, for "svm-train" and "svm-predict"
you want to choose "Win32 Console Project."
After libsvm 2.5, you can also use the file Makefile.win.
See details in README.


<p>
If you are not using Makefile.win and see the following 
link error
<pre>
LIBCMTD.lib(wwincrt0.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol

<p>
libsvm uses the so called "sparse" format where zero
values do not need to be stored. Hence a data with attributes
<pre>
1 0 2 0
</pre>
is represented as
<pre>
1:1 3:2

<p>
Currently libsvm supports only numerical data.
You may have to change non-numerical data to 
numerical. For example, you can use several
binary attributes to represent a categorical
attribute.

<p>
This is a controversial issue. The kernel
evaluation (i.e. inner product) of sparse vectors is slower 
so the total training time can be at least twice or three times
of that using the dense format.
However, we cannot support only dense format as then we CANNOT
handle extremely sparse cases. Simplicity of the code is another
concern. Right now we decide to support
the sparse format only.

obj is the optimal objective value of the dual SVM problem.
rho is the bias term in the decision function
sgn(w^Tx - rho).
nSV and nBSV are number of support vectors and bounded support
vectors (i.e., alpha_i = C). nu-svm is a somewhat equivalent
form of C-SVM where C is replaced by nu. nu simply shows the
corresponding parameter. More details are in

<p>
After the parameters, each line represents a support vector.
Support vectors are listed in the order of "labels" listed earlier.
(i.e., those from the first class in the "labels" list are
grouped first, and so on.) 
If k is the total number of classes,
in front of each support vector, there are
k-1 coefficients 
y*alpha where alpha are dual solution of the
following two class problems:
<br>
1 vs j, 2 vs j, ..., j-1 vs j, j vs j+1, j vs j+2, ..., j vs k
<br>
and y=1 in first j-1 coefficients, y=-1 in the remaining
k-j coefficients.

For example, if there are 4 classes, the file looks like:

|1|1|1|                    |

<p>
We have float as the default as you can store more numbers
in the cache. 
In general this is good enough but for few difficult
cases (e.g. C very very large) where solutions are huge
numbers, it might be possible that the numerical precision is not
enough using only float.

<p>
In general we suggest you to try the RBF kernel first.
A recent result by Keerthi and Lin
(<a href=http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/limit.ps.gz>
download paper here</a>)
shows that if RBF is used with model selection,
then there is no need to consider the linear kernel.
The kernel matrix using sigmoid may not be positive definite
and in general it's accuracy is not better than RBF.
(see the paper by Lin and Lin
(<a href=http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/tanh.pdf>
download paper here</a>).
Polynomial kernels are ok but if a high degree is used,
numerical difficulties tend to happen
(thinking about dth power of (<1) goes to 0
and (>1) goes to infinity).

<p>

No, at this point libsvm solves linear/nonlinear SVMs by the
same way.
Note that there are some possible
tricks to save training/testing time if the
linear kernel is used.
Hence libsvm is <b>NOT</b> particularly efficient for linear SVM,
especially for 
using large C on
problems whose number of data is much larger
than number of attributes.
You can 
<ul>
<li>
Use small C only. We have shown in the following paper
that after C is larger than a certain threshold,
the decision function is the same.

This usually happens when the data are overfitted.

try to scale them. Then the region

<p>
For the linear scaling method, if the RBF kernel is
used and parameter selection is conducted, there
is no difference. Assume Mi and mi are 
respectively the maximal and minimal values of the
ith attribute. Scaling to [0,1] means
<pre>
                x'=(x-mi)/(Mi-mi)
</pre>
For [-1,1],
<pre>
                x''=2(x-mi)/(Mi-mi)-1.
</pre>
In the RBF kernel,
<pre>
                x'-y'=(x-y)/(Mi-mi), x''-y''=2(x-y)/(Mi-mi).
</pre>
Hence, using (C,g) on the [0,1]-scaled data is the
same as (C,g/2) on the [-1,1]-scaled data.

<p> Though the performance is the same, the computational
time may be different. For data with many zero entries,
[0,1]-scaling keeps the sparsity of input data and hence
may save the time.

Basically they are the same thing but with different

<p>
We print out decision values for regression. For classification,
we solve several binary SVMs for multi-class cases, so 
you obtain values by easily calling the subroutine
svm_predict_values. Their corresponding labels
can be obtained from svm_get_labels. 
Details are in 
README of libsvm package. 

<p>
We do not recommend the following. But if you would
like to get values for 
TWO-class classification with labels +1 and -1
(note: +1 and -1 but not things like 5 and 10)
in the easiest way, simply add 
<pre>
		printf("%f\n", dec_values[0]*model->label[0]);
</pre>
after the line
<pre>
		svm_predict_values(model, x, dec_values);
</pre>
of the file svm.cpp.
Positive (negative)
decision values correspond to data predicted as +1 (-1).

The distance is |decision_value| / |w|. 
We have |w|^2 = w^Tw = alpha^T Q alpha = 2*(dual_obj + sum alpha_i).

<p>

On 32-bit machines, the maximum addressable
memory is 4GB. The Linux kernel uses 3:1
split which means user space is 3G and
kernel space is 1G. Although there are
3G user space, the maximum dynamic allocation
memory is 2G. So, if you specify -m near 2G,
the memory will be exhausted. And svm-train
will fail when it asks more memory.
For more details, please read 
<a href=http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=3BA164F6.BAFA4FB%40daimi.au.dk>
this article</a>.
<p>
There are two ways to solve this. If your
machine supports Intel's PAE (Physical Address
Extension), you can turn on the option HIGHMEM64G
in Linux kernel which uses 4G:4G split for
kernel and user space. If you don't, you can
try a software `tub' which can elimate the 2G
boundary for dymanic allocated memory. The `tub'
is available at 
<a href=http://www.bitwagon.com/tub.html>http://www.bitwagon.com/tub.html</a>.


<!--

This may happen only  when the cache is large, but each cached row is
not large enough. <b>Note:</b> This problem is specific to 
gnu C library which is used in linux.
The solution is as follows:

<p>
In our program we have malloc() which uses two methods 
to allocate memory from kernel. One is
sbrk() and another is mmap(). sbrk is faster, but mmap 
has a larger address
space. So malloc uses mmap only if the wanted memory size is larger
than some threshold (default 128k).
In the case where each row is not large enough (#elements < 128k/sizeof(float)) but we need a large cache ,
the address space for sbrk can be exhausted. The solution is to
lower the threshold to force malloc to use mmap
and increase the maximum number of chunks to allocate
with mmap.

<p>
Therefore, in the main program (i.e. svm-train.c) you want
to have
<pre>
      #include &lt;malloc.h&gt;
</pre>
and then in main():
<pre>
      mallopt(M_MMAP_THRESHOLD, 32768);
      mallopt(M_MMAP_MAX,1000000);
</pre>
You can also set the environment variables instead
of writing them in the program:
<pre>
$ M_MMAP_MAX=1000000 M_MMAP_THRESHOLD=32768 ./svm-train .....
</pre>

<p>
The reason why we have two functions is as follows:
For the RBF kernel exp(-g |xi - xj|^2), if we calculate
xi - xj first and then the norm square, there are 3n operations.
Thus we consider exp(-g (|xi|^2 - 2dot(xi,xj) +|xj|^2))
and by calculating all |xi|^2 in the beginning, 
the number of operations is reduced to 2n.
This is for the training.  For prediction we cannot
do this so a regular subroutine using that 3n operations is
needed.

The easiest way to have your own kernel is
to  put the same code in these two
subroutines by replacing any kernel.

<p>
It is extremely easy. Taking c-svc for example, only two 
places of svm.cpp have to be changed. 
First, modify the following line of 
solve_c_svc from 
<pre>
	s.Solve(l, SVC_Q(*prob,*param,y), minus_ones, y,
		alpha, Cp, Cn, param->eps, si, param->shrinking);
</pre>
to
<pre>
	s.Solve(l, SVC_Q(*prob,*param,y), minus_ones, y,
		alpha, INF, INF, param->eps, si, param->shrinking);
</pre>
Second, in  the class  of SVC_Q, declare C as 
a private variable:
<pre>
	double C;
</pre> 
In the constructor we assign it to param.C:
<pre>
        this->C = param.C;		
</pre>
Than in the the subroutine get_Q, after the for loop, add
<pre>
        if(i >= start && i < len) 
		data[i] += 1/C;
</pre>

For one-class svm, the modification is exactly the same. For SVR, you don't need an if statement like the above. Instead, you only need a simple assignment:
<pre>
	data[real_i] += 1/C;

<p>
To construct this probability model, we internaly conduct a 
cross validation, which is more time consuming than
a regular training.
Hence, in general you do parameter selection first without
-b 1. You only use -b 1 when good parameters have been
selected. In other words, you avoid using -b 1 and -v
together.

There is absolutely no reason the probability outputs guarantee
you better accuracy. The main purpose of this option is
to provide you the probability estimates, but not to boost
prediction accuracy. From our experience, 
after proper parameter selections, in general with

are some differences.

<p>
The program svm-toy assumes both attributes (i.e. x-axis and y-axis
values) are in (0,1). Hence you want to scale your 
data to between a small positive number and 
a number less than but very close to 1.
Moreover, class labels must be 1, 2, or 3
(not 1.0, 2.0 or anything else).

They are the same thing. We just rewrote the C++ code
in Java.

<p>
This depends on the VM you used. We have seen good
VM which leads the Java version to be quite competitive with
the C++ code. (though still slower)

You should try to increase the maximum Java heap size.
For example,
<pre>
java -Xmx256m svm_train.java ...
</pre>
sets the maximum heap size to 256M.

<p>
Unlike C, Java does not have a preprocessor built-in.
However,  we need some macros (see first 3 lines of svm.m4).

It seems the dll file is version dependent. So far we haven't
found out a good solution. Please email us if you have any
good suggestions.

<p>

To modify the interface, follow the instructions given in
<a href=http://www.swig.org/Doc1.1/HTML/Python.html#n2>
http://www.swig.org/Doc1.1/HTML/Python.html#n2</a>

<p>

If you just want to build DLL for a different python version,
after libsvm 2.5, you can easily use the file Makefile.win.
See details in README.

Alternatively, you can use Visual C++:
<ol>
<li> Create a Win32 DLL project and set (Build->Active Configuration) to "Release."
<li> Add svm.cpp, svmc_wrap.c, python2x.lib to your project.
<li> Add the directories containing Python.h and svm.h to
the Additional include directories. (in Project
Settings->C/C++->Preprocessor)
<li> add __WIN32__ to Preprocessor definitions
<li> Make sure that in the "General" category of
Project->Settings->Settings For "Win32 Release", Output
directories should be "Release"
<li> Build the DLL.
</ol>


<!--
There do exist work arounds, however. In
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/python-list/983252
they presented a solution: 1) find the version of python in the
registry 2) perform LoadLibrary("pythonxx.dll") and 3) resolve the
reference to functions through GetProcAddress. It is said that SWIG
may help on this.
http://mailman.cs.uchicago.edu/pipermail/swig/2001-July/002744.html
presented a similar example.
